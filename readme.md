# (ML)^2S

Welcome to the MIT Libraries Machine Learning Studio site.

The goal of this blog is to share the things we learn as we explore
applications of data mining, machine learning, and related techniques in the
Libraries.

We also will be running regular open meetings; stay tuned for details.

Want to add a post to this blog?
* Get edit permissions to the repo from anyone in DLAD if you don't have them yet (or else fork it to your own repo and make a pull request when you're ready)
  * Not familiar with github?
    * [Here's a tutorial](https://github.com/LibraryCodeYearIG/Codeyear-IG-Github-Project)
    * But you don't need to know anything about git to use the blog; you can just get a (free) github account, and edit files directly through the web editor
    * You can ask for help in the mitlibraries #codeclub Slack
* Before your first post, add yourself to the `authors` section of `_config.yaml`, following the existing example(s).
* Create a Markdown file in the `_posts/`directory with a title of the format `year-month-day-title.md`.
  * It should have front matter that looks like this:

```
---
author: < the label for you in _config.yaml >
---
```

It will automatically use the `post` layout. You may add a `title: < whatever >` if you want to override the title deduced from the filename.
