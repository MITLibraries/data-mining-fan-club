# Data Mining Fan Club

Welcome to the MIT Libraries Data Mining Fan Club site.

The goal of this blog is to share the things we learn as we explore
applications of data mining, machine learning, and related techniques in the
Libraries.

We also will be running regular open meetings; stay tuned for details.
