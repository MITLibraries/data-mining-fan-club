# Projects

Here are some machine learning projects (whether big-P, little-p, or experimentation) we're working on.

* [Mundaneum](https://github.com/MITLibraries/mundaneum)
  * Trains a [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)-based neural net on MIT thesis data to look for document and word clustering
* [precog_svm](https://github.mit.edu/mjbernha/precog_svm) (MIT internal only)
